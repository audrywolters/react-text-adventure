# react-text-adventure-game

## Background
Rewiting an [older angular 1 project](https://github.com/deeheber/text-adventure-game) in react for fun and to practice react.

## Description
An office inspired escape game. Can you sneak out of work early without your boss knowing to meet your top pal at the Pabst Music Festival?

This is a wip and a live link to play the game will be available here upon completion.

## Install Instructions
1. Clone repo
2. `cd` into the root folder and `yarn install`
3. `yarn start` will run a dev version of the app on port 3000
